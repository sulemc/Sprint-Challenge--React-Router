1.	What is the difference between server side routing and client side routing?
With server side routing, a new request to the server must be made every time the user wants to view a different page within the website. This makes loading time between pages longer. With client side routing all the pages are preloaded which makes the initial load time longer but faster between the pages.
2.	Mention some advantages of using client side routing.
Client side routing allows for more ease in navigating around a website.
3.	Which component is used to define a route and what props are commonly added to it?
You use the Route component and give it the react object you wish to route to.
4.	How can I make sure that the component associated with the "/" route is not displayed for every other route?
Exact, exact = true
